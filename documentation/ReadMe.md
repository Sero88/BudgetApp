Budget App

This app is to help me keep track of my expenses. Know exactly how much money I have at a specific time.

View categories where my money is being spent. 

Set budget for each category, and see the actuals between my spending and the budgets I have set. 

Having this will help me realize how much I spent and on what exactly. See where I can cut costs as well. 

Serves as a good laravel starting project, and also even get started w/ graphs.


Features I want:
* View how much I have spent monthly
* View how much I have spent yearly
* View break down of each category
* View budget vs actuals
* CRUD expense
* Authentication - Multiple users.
** cookie saving - so you don't have to login every time
*** Google? Sign in with Google?
* Automatic expenses - cron job of sorts?
